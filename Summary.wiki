= A Cellular Potts Model (CPM) of Colorectal Cancer =

Designed only to work as bolt-on project for Chaste v3.2 or v3.3.

== Getting the code and installing dependencies ==

Before running these examples you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.3].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on [wiki:InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage]. 
Note that Chaste is only fully supported on !Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X may need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

You will also need the source for the PottsCrypt2015 project.  This can be done by checking out the version from the repository by using the command 
{{{
svn checkout https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/svn/chaste/projects/PottsCrypt2015
}}}
in the projects folder of the Chaste directory. 

Now the project should be installed, and everything should compile and run correctly. 
You can now run the tests or simulations, or create your own test suites.

== Documentation ==
There are three folders - `src`, `test` and `matlab`.
 1. The `src` folder contains the following classes:
  * `CellShapeOutputModifier.xpp` - Modifier class to Output the Area Perimeter and Circularity of cells in a simulation.
  * `FixedSimpleWntCellCycleModel.xpp` - A version of the [https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/public-docs/classSimpleWntCellCycleModel.html SimpleWntCellCycleModel] class to represent the cell cycle model as described in the paper.
  * `MutantBaseTrackerModifier.xpp` - Modifier class which tracks the base (and top) of the mutant patch.
  * `MutantCellPottsUpdateRule.xpp` - The component of the Hamiltonian (represented as a `PottsUpdateRule`) which models mutant cells as described in the paper.
  1. The `test` folder contains:
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/PottsCrypt2015/PottsCrypt TestPottsCryptLiteratePaper.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure TODO.
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/PottsCrypt2015/PottsCryptMutant TestPottsCryptLiteratePaperMutant.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure TODO.
  * [wiki:PaperTutorials/PottsCrypt2015/PottsCryptSweeps TestPottsCryptLiteratePaperSweeps.hpp] - this file can be run to generate the results in Figure TODO.
  1 The `matlab` folder contains:
  * TODO
== Running tests ==
You can then run tests and simulations with, for example,
{{{
cd <Chaste3.3 path>
scons b=GccOpt ts=projects/PottsCrypt2015/test/TestPottsCryptLiteratePaper.hpp
}}}

----
'''NB''': the paper was developed with release version 3.2 and 3.3. It will not work with with release version 3.1 or under.
